Then, if considered relevant, determine if it is applied or not in the given architecture diagram image.</step>
  <step>2) For each of the ${numberOfBestPractices} best practices listed in the "<best_practices_json>" section, create and return your answer as a JSON between <json_response> and </json_response> tags following the exact format as below example:

      "reasonNotApplied": [Why do you consider this best practice is not applied or followed in the provided architecture diagram? (Important: 100 words maximum and only add this field when relevant=true and applied=false)],
      "recommendations": [Provide recommendations for the best practice. Include what is the risk of not following, and also provide recommendations and examples of how to implement this best practice. (Important: 400 words maximum and only add this field when relevant=true and applied=false)]

     - Supporting documents may show account-level services, organizational policies, or pre-existing infrastructure</step>

     - It's implemented at a higher architectural layer (account/organizational level)
     - It's managed outside the specific workload architecture diagram

  When determining if a best practice is "relevant", consider whether it can be meaningfully assessed from the technical artifact provided:

  1. Mark a best practice as "relevant: true" ONLY if:
     - The [**Technical Relevancy score:**] for the particular best practice within the <kb> section is 7 or greater than 7.
     - It directly relates to AWS resources, configurations, architecture patterns, or technical implementations
     - Evidence of its application (or lack thereof) can be observed in the provided architecture diagram

  2. Mark a best practice as "relevant: false" if:
     - The [**Technical Relevancy score:**] for the particular best practice within the <kb> section is 6 or less than 6.
     - It primarily concerns organizational processes, team structures, or governance (e.g., "Establish ownership of cost optimization")
     - It focuses on business practices not reflected in technical implementations (e.g., "Evaluate external customer needs")
     - It involves human procedures, meetings, or operational activities that happen outside the infrastructure definition
     - It cannot be reasonably assessed by examining the technical artifact provided

  For best practices marked as "relevant: false", do not include the "applied" field or any recommendations, as these cannot be meaningfully determined from the provided artifact.

  <step>1) In the "<best_practices_json>" section, you are provided with the name of the ${numberOfBestPractices} Best Practices related to the questions "${question.title}" of the ${lensContext}. For each Best Practice, first, determine if it is relevant to the provided PDF architecture documentation file(s) (refer to the <note_on_relevance> section below for more details). Then, if considered relevant, determine if it is applied or not in the given documentation.</step>
  <step>2) For each of the ${numberOfBestPractices} best practices listed in the "<best_practices_json>" section, create and return your answer as a JSON between <json_response> and </json_response> tags following the exact format below:
  \`\`\`
  <json_response>
  {
      "bestPractices": [
        {
          "name": [Exact Best Practice Name as given in Best Practices in the "<best_practices_json>" section],
          "relevant": [Boolean],
          "applied": [Boolean - Only add this field when relevant=true],
          "reasonApplied": [Why do you consider this best practice is already applied or followed in the provided architecture document? Include specific PDF file name and section references. (Important: 150 words maximum and only add this field when relevant=true and applied=true)],
          "reasonNotApplied": [Why do you consider this best practice is not applied or followed in the provided architecture document? Include specific PDF file name and section references where applicable. (Important: 150 words maximum and only add this field when relevant=true and applied=false)],
          "recommendations": [Provide recommendations for the best practice. Include what is the risk of not following, and also provide recommendations and examples of how to implement this best practice, citing specific PDF file name and section references where the recommendation applies.

  <step>4) Do not make any assumptions or make up information. Your responses should only be based on the information provided in the attached PDF architecture documentation file(s), together with the attached supporting document (if provided). Refer to the "<supporting_document>" for specific instructions and descriptions related to the supporting document.</step>
  <step>5) When referencing the PDF documentation, always cite the specific PDF file name and the section where you found evidence related to your analysis (e.g., "In Architecture.pdf, around the section about "Implemented Service Control Policies" ").</step>
  <step>6) You are also provided with a Knowledge Base which has information about the specific question's best practices from the ${lensContext}. The relevant parts from the Knowledge Base will be provided under the "<kb>" section.</step>

  <step>1. First, thoroughly examine BOTH the PDF architecture documentation file(s) AND any supporting documents provided</step>
  <step>2. Supporting documents may be in various formats (.pdf, .txt, .png, .jpg, .jpeg) and contain critical context not visible in the PDF architecture documentation file(s) alone</step>
  <step>3. Consider the architectural layers: 
     - PDF architecture documentation file(s) defines workload-specific resources
     - Supporting documents may show account-level services, organizational policies, or pre-existing infrastructure</step>
  <step>4. When a best practice appears to be implemented in the supporting document but not in the PDF architecture documentation file(s), consider it "applied" if:
     - It's implemented at a higher architectural layer (account/organizational level)
     - It's managed outside the specific workload PDF architecture documentation file(s)
     - It would affect or apply to the resources defined in the PDF architecture documentation file(s)</step>
  <step>5. In your reasoning fields, explicitly cite which source informed your assessment using "[From PDF]" or "[From Supporting Doc]" prefixes</step>
  </document_processing>
  
  <note_on_relevance>
  <thinking>
  When determining if a best practice is "relevant", consider whether it can be meaningfully assessed from the documentation provided:

  1. Mark a best practice as "relevant: true" ONLY if:
     - The [**Technical Relevancy score:**] for the particular best practice within the <kb> section is 7 or greater than 7.
     - It directly relates to AWS resources, configurations, architecture patterns, or technical implementations
     - Evidence of its application (or lack thereof) can be observed from the information provided in the PDF documentation file(s)

  2. Mark a best practice as "relevant: false" if:
     - The [**Technical Relevancy score:**] for the particular best practice within the <kb> section is 6 or less than 6.
     - It primarily concerns organizational processes, team structures, or governance (e.g., "Establish ownership of cost optimization")
     - It focuses on business practices not reflected in technical implementations (e.g., "Evaluate external customer needs")
     - It involves human procedures, meetings, or operational activities that happen outside the infrastructure definition
     - It cannot be reasonably assessed by examining the documentation provided

  For best practices marked as "relevant: false", do not include the "applied" field or any recommendations, as these cannot be meaningfully determined from the provided artifact.
