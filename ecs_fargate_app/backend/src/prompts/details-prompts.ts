    The attached file named "${supportingDocName}" has been provided as a supporting document that contains CRITICAL context for your detailed analysis. This document may be in any format (.pdf, .txt, .png, .jpg, .jpeg) and requires your careful analysis.

    IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS:
    1. Begin by thoroughly examining this supporting document BEFORE analyzing the IaC template(s) or project
    2. Extract all relevant information, especially:
      - Account-level or organization-level services/configurations
      - Pre-existing infrastructure that interacts with the IaC template(s) or project
      - Security controls, governance mechanisms, and operational procedures
      - Architectural patterns and relationships not visible in the IaC template(s) or project alone
    
    3. When assessing best practices, consider the COMPLETE ARCHITECTURE:
      - The IaC template(s) or project may implement workload-specific resources
      - The supporting document may show broader context (account-level services, shared resources)
    
    4. If your detailed analysis is influenced by this supporting document:
      - Begin your reasoning with "[From Supporting Doc]" 
      - Explicitly state which elements from the supporting document led to your conclusion
      - Explain how these elements relate to the resources defined in the IaC template(s) or project
