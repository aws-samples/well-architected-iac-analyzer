  The attached file named "${supportingDocName}" has been provided as a supporting document that contains CRITICAL context for your assessment. This document may be in any format (.pdf, .txt, .png, .jpg, .jpeg) and requires your careful analysis.

  IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS:
  1. Begin by thoroughly examining this supporting document BEFORE analyzing the architecture diagram image
  2. Extract all relevant information, especially:
     - Account-level or organization-level services/configurations
     - Pre-existing infrastructure that interacts with the architecture diagram image
     - Security controls, governance mechanisms, and operational procedures
     - Architectural patterns and relationships not visible in the architecture diagram image alone
  
  3. When assessing best practices, consider the COMPLETE ARCHITECTURE:
     - The architecture diagram image may implement workload-specific resources
     - The supporting document may show broader context (account-level services, shared resources)
     - A best practice should be considered "applied" if implemented at ANY layer affecting the workload
  
  4. If your assessment is influenced by this supporting document:
     - Begin your reasoning with "[From Supporting Doc]" 
     - Explicitly state which elements from the supporting document led to your conclusion
     - Explain how these elements relate to the resources defined in the architecture diagram image
